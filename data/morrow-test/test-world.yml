        Upon closer examination, this chest is nothing more that a poorly made
        apple box, all rough and unaged wood, held together by bands of metal
        and a handful of bent nails.

        Shoulders hunched, and back bent, this man stands as
        though the world has beaten him, and he is bracing for the next
        blow.  His eyes, downcast and lined with concern, dart about the
        room, never lighting on anything for more than a moment.
